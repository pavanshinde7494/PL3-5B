                    Android is an open-source and Linux-based Operating System for mobile devices such as
                     smartphones and tablet computers. Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance, 
                     led by Google, and other companies. It is an operating system and programming platform 
                     developed by Google for mobile phones and other mobile devices, such as tablets. It 
                     can run on many different devices from many different manufacturers. Android includes 
                     a software development kit (SDK) that helps you write original code and assemble software 
                     modules to create apps for Android users. Android also provides a marketplace to distribute 
                     apps. All together,  Android represents an ecosystem for mobile apps.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Developers create apps for a variety of reasons. They may need to  
                    address business requirements or build new services or businesses, or they may want to 
                    offer games and other types of content for users. Developers choose to develop for Android 
                    in order to reach the majority of mobile device users.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Why to Use Android?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    a) It is the most popular platform for mobile apps.
                    As the world’s most popular mobile platform, Android powers hundreds 
                    of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. 
                    It has the largest installed base of any mobile platform and is still 
                    growing fast. Every day another million users power up their Android-powered
                     devices for the first time and start looking for apps, games, and other digital content.
                    <br><br>b) Best experience for app users
                    Android provides a touchscreen user interface (UI) for interacting with apps. Android’s 
                    UI is mainly based on direct manipulation. People use touch gestures such as swiping, 
                    tapping and pinching to manipulate on-screen objects. In addition to the keyboard, there’s 
                    a customizable on-screen keyboard for text input. Android can also support game controllers 
                    and full-size physical keyboards connected by Bluetooth or USB.
                    <br><br>
                    c) It’s easy to develop apps
                    To develop apps that take advantage of the Android operating system and UI, developers can use the 
                    Android software development kit (SDK). The SDK includes software libraries of prewritten code, 
                    a debugger, a device emulator, documentation, sample code, and tutorials that help to easily 
                    develop an android app. The design feature for XML pages instead of writing code helps a lot to 
                    boost the confidence of beginners in the android application development.
