          Caste is a delicate issue. It's ubiquitous, and we are full of it. We should start to change things from individual level. 
          But when you go to people and deny caste, they may not react favourably. I think if a decisive percentage of people, 
          especially elites, start marrying out of their caste, we may see a casteless India in a generation's time<em>-Pavan Kalyan</em>

        <blockquote>
          History and social sciences were my interests. I was always interested in knowing how societies get organized, why there is 
          rich and poor divide, why there are classes. I was never apolitical. I think we are all political in a way. Politics decides 
          our day-to-day life.
